# It's a fish
It's a Fish is a small word game based around fish of course! Objective of the game is to unscramble the fish names and answer questions until your screen is covered in bubbles and you aren't able to anymore! 
Over time bubbles spawn, once you answer a question all the bubbles pop and you're given a new word. Goodluck!
